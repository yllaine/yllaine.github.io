<p>If you really know me, you know I would always opt for a savory breakfast over a sweet one. But not if it is <strong>Taco Vengo’s chwaffle &agrave; la mode</strong>. I wouldn't mind eating it anytime of the day even if that means eating a dessert as my first meal.</p>

<p>Expect to wait a little because they will just cook it as soon as you order it. Crispy on the outside but chewy on the inside, this waffle will rstrongind you of your favorite churro (with cinnamon sugar sprinkling) sans the chocolate dipping sauce. This piping hot fresh from the waffle machine favorite is topped with vanilla ice cream that's dusted with cinnamon powder creating a contrast of different tstrongperatures inside your mouth. It is then finished off with a dollop of dulce de Leche for a more Latin American feel. To fully enjoy the experience, get a bit of each&mdash;waffle, ice cream, and dulce de leche&mdash;and feel the different textures and levels of sweetness without overwhelming your palate. Don't forget to order their <strong>horchata</strong> to complete your experience. Everything just goes perfectly well together. If you’re in for a treat, try this Mexican twist to the breakfast classic waffle and milk combo.</p>
